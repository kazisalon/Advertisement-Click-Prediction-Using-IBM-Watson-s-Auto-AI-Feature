# Advertisement-Click-Prediction-Using-IBM-Watson-s-Auto-AI-Feature
This project leverages IBM Watson's Auto-AI feature to predict whether a user is likely to view an advertisement. By creating a Watson Studio instance, loading datasets, and deploying machine learning models, the solution automates the prediction process and integrates it with a user-friendly UI deployed on Heroku.
